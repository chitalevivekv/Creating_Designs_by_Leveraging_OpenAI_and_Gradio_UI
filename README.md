# Advanced Generative AI Project- Creating Designs by Leveraging OpenAI and Gradio UI 
## Submitted by- Vivek Chitale
Problem Statement:
Overview
In this project, you will explore the transformative potential of OpenAI's API and Gradio UI in the creative design industry. The project outlines hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate AI's ability to generate images from text prompts. These scenarios offer a glimpse into a future where technology enhances creativity.

Instructions
• Review the learning materials and the Gradio documentation provided for the project. • Read the sections on situation, task, action, and result carefully to understand the assignment. • Complete and submit your assignment through the Learning Management System (LMS). • Adhere closely to the provided guidelines, ensuring your submission contains all necessary analyses and interpretations.

Situation
You work as a designer at a cutting-edge creative agency. Your task involves revolutionizing visual content creation for digital marketing campaigns, especially for high-profile clients such as Netflix. You have access to an innovative web-based platform. This platform combines OpenAI's API with Gradio's web interface.

Task
Your task is to create a platform that generates bespoke images and designs for banners and posters by entering text prompts. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's DALL-E, you aim to transform abstract ideas into tangible, visually compelling designs. These designs will captivate audiences and enhance promotional efforts for Netflix's latest campaigns.

Action
• Import essential libraries such as Gradio for building web interfaces for machine learning models, the requests library for fetching image data via HTTP requests, the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image processing, io.BytesIO for managing binary data streams, and the OpenAI library for accessing the OpenAI API. These libraries collectively enable the transformation of text prompts into images. • Create a function named generate_image to oversee the image generation process using text prompts. • Set up the Gradio interface using gr.Interface, including a textbox for text prompt input and an image display for showcasing generated images. • Launch the Gradio interface to make it available for user interaction.

Result
Upon completing this project, you will submit an IPYNB file. This file will showcase the innovative potential of integrating OpenAI's API and Gradio UI in the creative design industry. It focuses on generating customized visual content for Netflix campaigns
